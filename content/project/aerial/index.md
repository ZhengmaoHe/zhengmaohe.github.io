1. Drone Motion Control
    * Gimbal control
        * According to the gimbal model, design the feed-forward-serial controller to realize the gimbal motion and muzzle launch.
        * Use CAN, UART and other communication protocols to realize the bottom control.
    * Airframe control
        * Combine the UAV model and simulation test to design the controller.
        * Application development of DJI A3 Onboard SDK on STM32 chip and deployment of the above controller.
        * Fuse sensor data such as optical flow and TOF to achieve centimeter-level fixed-point hovering.
2. Joint commissioning:
        * Transmit height, speed and other data to NUC through serial protocol, and receive gimbal target angle.
        * Adopt Kalman filter to make the gimbal can follow the target angle smoothly.

* Innovation:
    * Design a new type of gimbal self-stabilization model, which can avoid the effect of launch vibration on self-stabilization effect and reduce the cost significantly.
    * Creatively designed a self-stabilization algorithm for the launch state vehicle based on a simplified model, so that the UAV can maintain centimeter-level precision hovering in the muzzle high-frequency launch state.
